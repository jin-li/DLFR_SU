# Description
These are DLFR two-dimensional core models, for different periods(BoL, BoC, EoC and EoL, where BoL means beginning of life, BoC means beginning of cycle, EoC means end of cycle, EoL means end of life).  
# File Name  
The file name indicates its periods and whether safety assemblies are inserted in core, for example:
- dlfr_core_2d_bol means core in beginning of life, with safety assembly in
- dlfr_core_2d_bol_nosafe means core in beginning of life, with safety assembly out
