These are DLFR fuel and safety assembly models, for different positions(inner core and outer core) and different fuel materials(BoL, BoC, EoC and EoL, where BoL means beginning of life, BoC means beginning of cycle, EoC means end of cycle, EoL means end of life).  
  
The file name indicates its position and material, for example:
- dlfr_assm_boci means beginning of cycle, inner core  
- dlfr_assm_safe_boci means safety assembly surrounded by beginning of cycle assemblies, inner core  

To be noted, safety assemblies are all in inner core, so there is no safety assembly surrounded by outer core assemblies
